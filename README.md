# ðŸ“š TopoChip Podocyte Image Analysis

## Overview

This repository supports the paper:

**"Acquisition, Quality Control, and Architecture of a Large Image Dataset as a Tool for In Silico Cell Biological Research"**

It contains all code, metadata, SOPs, and reproducible workflows used to build a scalable, FAIR-aligned image analysis pipeline for studying how podocytes respond to biomaterial topographies using the TopoChip platform.
